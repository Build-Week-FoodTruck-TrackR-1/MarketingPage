                Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Every
                time you practice, you learn more.

                Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. You don't have to be crazy to do this but
                it does help.
