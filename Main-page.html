                Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Every
                time you practice, you learn more.

                Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Those great big fluffy clouds.

                Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. You don't have to be crazy to do this but
                it does help.

                When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. All those little son of a guns. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of
                Prussian blue It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death.

                If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. Just use the old one inch brush. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just
                let them happen. I get carried away with this brush cleaning.
